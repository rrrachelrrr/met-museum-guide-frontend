Welcome to the Metropolitan Museum Guide! Please make an account so you can get started.

This app was built as a capstone project at Flatiron School's Access Labs. It uses the Metropolitan Museum's API to search through the museum's extensive archives to find artwork relevant to the user's search. If you are an artist looking for inspiration, a student looking for reference images, or just a visitor to the Met looking for works to see, please test it out! Once you have completed your search, you can save your favorite found artworks to your profile page. Once within your profile page, you can sort through your favorite images using either the search bar or your created tags.

Thank you for trying out my app!
